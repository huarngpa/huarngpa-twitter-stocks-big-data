# Big Data Stack Overview
This is the big data package of the final project. For this part of the stack, I relied on the core technologies we learned about in class (Hadoop, Hive, HBase, Spark), but chose to focus on Spark as the primary point of interface/coordination of the batch, serving, and speed layers.
